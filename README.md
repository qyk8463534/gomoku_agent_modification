# How to watch the result?
run the train.py will show all three instances of game without randomized move function while run the train_randomized.py will show two instances of game with randomized move function. All the games are played by mcts+NN AI and baseline AI


run the train_test.py will  test the ability of of mcts tree. The game is plays by mcts+NN and baseline AI.

After the trainning part, we can use tensorboard to watch all the graph which are generated by the program. The folder with r in the end of its name indicates that it is a randomized game
